# Android Studio 2.2.0 with CMake support does not pack stl shared libraries,
# so app needs to pack the right shared lib into APK. This sample uses solution
# from https://github.com/jomof/ndk-stl to find the right stl shared lib to use
# and copy it to the right place for Android Studio to pack
# Usage: download ndk-stl-config.cmake into app's directory hosting CMakeLists.txt
#        and just use it with the following line
include(ndk-stl-config.cmake)
